🚗 **Car Price Prediction**

This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on key features like brand, model, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. It applies machine learning algorithms to build a regression model that estimates car prices with high accuracy.

🎯 **Objective**

To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car using historical data, helping users or dealers to make informed decisions while buying or selling vehicles.
